## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

 Users are able to enter hourly pay and hours worked and get their net pay with all the taxes deducted. This application takes in the hourly wage and based on that  figure, it will figure out what tax bracket the user is in by calculating the wage times forty hours for a year and set the federal tax to that tax bracket. When a user enters a number of hours over forty the application will run a conditional and if the value is over forty hours it will apply time and a half to the wage the user enters otherwise itâ€™ll only calculate straight time. Once the user enters the information a pie chart will show up and dynamically have the pay information broken down inside it. This application was made to ease the experience for users trying to quickly get their payment information without having to enter many points of data.


## Optimizations

Planning on adding biweekly pay calculation functonality to the app along with salary to have more options depending the users situation
